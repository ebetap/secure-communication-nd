### SecureCommunication Class

The `SecureCommunication` class provides secure communication between two parties using modern cryptographic techniques in Node.js. It includes key exchange, encryption, decryption, hashing, signing, and signature verification to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

### Concept

The concept behind `SecureCommunication` revolves around using a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography for secure communication:

1. **Key Exchange**: 
   - **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)** is used to establish a shared secret key between two parties.
   - **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) principles** are simulated using random bit generation and comparison to derive a shared secret.

2. **Encryption**:
   - **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode) is used for symmetric encryption of data.
   - AES provides confidentiality (encryption) and integrity (through the use of the Authentication Tag).

3. **Hashing**:
   - **SHA3-512** is used for hashing data to ensure data integrity.

4. **Signing**:
   - **SHA-256** is used for signing data to ensure data authenticity and non-repudiation.

5. **Sending and Receiving Data**:
   - Data is encrypted, hashed, and signed before sending.
   - Upon receiving, the signature is verified, and then the data is decrypted and processed.

### Flow

The flow of communication between two parties using `SecureCommunication` involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an instance of `SecureCommunication`.
   - Initialize the class, which generates a key pair for ECDH and initializes necessary parameters.

2. **Key Exchange**:
   - Call `exchangeKeys()` to simulate the key exchange process:
     - Generate random bits and bases for Alice.
     - Generate random bases for Bob.
     - Calculate shared key bits using Quantum Key Distribution principles.
     - Derive AES key from shared key bits.

3. **Data Sending**:
   - Encrypt data using `encryptData(data)`.
   - Hash encrypted data using `hashData(data)`.
   - Sign hashed data using `signData(data)`.
   - Package data and necessary parameters (encrypted data, IV, authTag, hash, signature, public key).

4. **Data Receiving**:
   - Receive data package containing (encrypted data, IV, authTag, hash, signature, public key).
   - Verify signature using `verifySignature(data, signature, publicKey)`.
   - Decrypt data using `decryptData(encrypted, iv, authTag)`.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Clear sensitive data using `clearSensitiveData()`.

**Usage:**

```javascript
import SecureCommunication from './SecureCommunication';

async function main() {
  const secureComm = new SecureCommunication();

  // Exchange keys
  await secureComm.exchangeKeys();

  // Simulate sending data
  const dataToSend = 'Sensitive data to be sent securely';
  const secureData = await secureComm.sendData(dataToSend);
  console.log('Secure data to be sent:', secureData);

  // Simulate receiving data
  const receivedData = await secureComm.receiveData(secureData);
  console.log('Received and decrypted data:', receivedData);

  // Clear sensitive data from the instance
  secureComm.clearSensitiveData();
}

main().catch(err => console.error('Error in main:', err));
```

### How to Use

1. **Initialization**:
   - Import the `SecureCommunication` class.
   - Create an instance of `SecureCommunication`.

2. **Key Exchange**:
   - Call `exchangeKeys()` to simulate the key exchange process.

3. **Sending Data**:
   - Use `sendData(data)` to encrypt, hash, sign, and package data for sending.

4. **Receiving Data**:
   - Use `receiveData(dataPackage)` to verify signature, decrypt, and process received data.

5. **Cleanup**:
   - Always clear sensitive data using `clearSensitiveData()` after use.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that sensitive data (AES keys, shared secret bits) are cleared from memory using `crypto.randomFillSync` after use.
- Proper error handling ensures that no sensitive information is leaked.
- Use modern cryptographic algorithms and principles to maintain strong security.

### Error Handling

- Errors are caught and rethrown with meaningful messages to avoid leaking sensitive information.
- Proper error handling ensures that applications can gracefully handle exceptions.
