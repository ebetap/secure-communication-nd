# Secure Communication Module Documentation

## Overview

The `SecureCommunication` module provides a secure communication protocol leveraging cryptographic techniques such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange, AES-256-GCM encryption, SHA-3-512 hashing, and SHA-256 digital signatures. It aims to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between communicating parties.

### Key Features

- **Key Exchange:** Uses ECDH to establish a shared secret key between parties.
- **Encryption:** Utilizes AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption of data.
- **Hashing:** Applies SHA-3-512 for hashing data to ensure integrity.
- **Signing:** Implements SHA-256 digital signatures to provide data authenticity.
- **Secure Data Transmission:** Facilitates secure data exchange with encryption, hashing, and signing mechanisms.

## Concepts

### 1. ECDH Key Exchange

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is used to securely exchange cryptographic keys over an insecure channel. It allows two parties to generate a shared secret key without transmitting it directly.

### 2. AES-256-GCM Encryption

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key size of 256 bits in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) provides authenticated encryption. It ensures both confidentiality and integrity of data.

### 3. SHA-3-512 Hashing

Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3) with a hash size of 512 bits generates a unique fixed-size hash value from input data. It verifies data integrity by detecting any modifications.

### 4. SHA-256 Digital Signatures

SHA-256 is used for creating digital signatures, which are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of data. The private key signs data, and the corresponding public key verifies the signature.

## Flow

### Initialization

1. **Constructor Initialization:**
   - Initializes AES encryption algorithm (`'aes-256-gcm'`), hash algorithm (`'sha3-512'`), and signature algorithm (`'sha256'`).
   - Generates ECDH key pair (`privateKey` and `publicKey`) using the secp256k1 curve.

2. **Key Exchange (`exchangeKeys()` Method):**
   - Generates random bits and bases for Alice and Bob.
   - Measures qubits and compares bases to derive a shared secret key (`aesKey`) using Quantum Key Distribution principles.
   - Derives AES encryption key (`aesKey`) from the shared secret key bits.

### Data Transmission

3. **Data Encryption (`encryptData(data)` Method):**
   - Encrypts input data (`data`) using AES-256-GCM.
   - Generates a random Initialization Vector (IV).
   - Computes authentication tag for integrity verification.

4. **Data Hashing and Signing (`sendData(data)` Method):**
   - Hashes encrypted data using SHA-3-512 to create a hash (`hash`).
   - Signs the hash using SHA-256 and the module's private key (`privateKey`) to generate a digital signature (`signature`).

5. **Data Decryption and Verification (`receiveData(data)` Method):**
   - Verifies the digital signature (`signature`) using the sender's public key (`publicKey`).
   - Decrypts encrypted data (`encrypted`) using AES-256-GCM and the received IV and authentication tag.

### Cleanup

6. **Sensitive Data Management (`clearSensitiveData()` Method):**
   - Clears sensitive data such as `aesKey` and `privateKey` securely after use using cryptographic techniques.

## Usage

### Installation

Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install crypto
```

### Example Usage

```javascript
import SecureCommunication from './SecureCommunication'; // Assuming file location

async function secureCommunicationExample() {
  try {
    const secureComm = new SecureCommunication();

    // Alice sends data to Bob
    await secureComm.exchangeKeys();
    const dataToSend = 'Hello, Bob!';
    const encryptedPackage = await secureComm.sendData(dataToSend);

    // Bob receives and processes data from Alice
    const decryptedData = await secureComm.receiveData(encryptedPackage);
    console.log('Decrypted data:', decryptedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in secure communication:', error.message);
  }
}

secureCommunicationExample();
```

### Notes

- Ensure proper error handling and testing for robustness.
- Review and update cryptographic algorithms periodically to adhere to security best practices.

## Conclusion

The `SecureCommunication` module provides a robust framework for secure data exchange using modern cryptographic techniques. It aims to protect data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, ensuring secure communication between parties.
